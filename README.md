# D3graph: Interactive force-directed networks

``d3graph`` is a python package that simplifies the task of creating **interactive** and **stand-alone** networks in **d3 javascript** using **python**.
For this package, I was inspired by d3 JavaScript, but there was no Python package that could create such interactive networks. Here it is: a library that automatically creates D3 JavaScript and HTML code based on an input adjacency matrix in Python! This library does not require any additional installation, downloads, or setting paths to your system's environments. You just need Python and this library. All other is taken care of. Huray! Navigate to [API documentations](https://erdogant.github.io/d3graph/) for more detailed information. **⭐️ Star it if you like it ⭐️**
